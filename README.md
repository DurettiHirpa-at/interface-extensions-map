_an Airtable interface extension that utilizes Mapbox to graph grocery stores in the DC area_

What you'll need:
* a Mapbox account with a generated token
* an Airtable account

This block is pretty specific to the data it uses, which has been uploaded as `Stores.csv` for your convenience. This data comes from an open dataset on data.gov.

You can reference this block as a template once you've generated your own block in your Airtable workspace. Once you have a block ID just run this:

```
$ block init NONE/[YOUR BLOCKID HERE] --template=https://github.com/DurettiHirpa-at/interface-extensions-map
```

Once you've created your local block, feel free to remix and modify to your heart's content. Buena suerte üçÄ
